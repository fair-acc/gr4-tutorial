# GNURadio 4.0 Tutorial example projects

This repository contains example projects based on (the development version) GNURadio 4.0.

There are two different subprojects:
 - oot-blocklib: contains an out-of-tree block-library with various blocks and corresponding tests
 - application: a sample application that uses gnuradio as a processing framework
                Real world examples of this usage are e.g. gqrx
